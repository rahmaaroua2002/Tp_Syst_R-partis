In Java, exceptions are categorized into two main types: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions.

Checked Exceptions:

Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked at compile-time.
They are subclasses of Exception but not subclasses of RuntimeException.
The developer is required to handle these exceptions explicitly either by using a try-catch block or by declaring the exception to be thrown (using the throws keyword) in the method signature.
Examples of checked exceptions in Java include IOException, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException, etc.
Unchecked Exceptions:

Unchecked exceptions, also known as runtime exceptions, are not checked at compile-time.
They are subclasses of RuntimeException or Error.
The developer is not required to handle unchecked exceptions explicitly, although they can choose to do so.
Examples of unchecked exceptions in Java include NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ArithmeticException, IllegalArgumentException, etc.
In summary, the main difference between checked and unchecked exceptions lies in when they are checked by the compiler. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time and must be handled explicitly, whereas unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, and handling them is optional.
